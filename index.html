        <p class="lead mb-4"> While I was studying in High School, I recently found joy in Teaching students and loved econ. I took the initiative to become a Teachers Assistant, I absolutely loved it. My job was to tutor kids that could understand the material during lecture hours, I would prepare worksheets and practice problems for students who were struggling. I would also grade tests and quizzez, give feedback to students on what they can improve on.  </p><br><br>

        After graduation I stumbles upon a job at a Middle Eastern restaurant. What really struck me to accept the job was the atmosphere around the restaurant, the workers, the customers and everything tied in together was absolutely mesmerizing. I worked as a Server during my time there, I loved it, my job there was to make sure customers got everything they were looking for, ring them up and make sure they are on there way home, happy and healthy with all their needs being fulfilled. I also brough drinks and food out for them when it was ready, I greeted customers when they entered the restaurant and sat them down at their table<br><br>

        After my job as a Cashier I reached out to a couple of my friends and explained I have an Idea about developing a website for a company. After days ad days of convinging, they were on board and told me to go for it. I then researched for companies that are not yet known and have no website, and I stumbked upon an Insurance company that did not have a website, I contaced the owner and included him in my plan and finally he agreed. My friends and I then strted to work where we developed coded for a website of the company, sooner than later the website was up and running.After that, the company blew up, people loved the website, then out of nowhere the president of the company was reaching out to me for an internship at his company and he loved if I was to join their family and work directly under him last summer, I accepted, did the internship and it was one of the best things I decided to do.
